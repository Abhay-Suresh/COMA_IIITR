This study systematically examines how different optimization paradigms perform and scale when applied to the **0/1 Knapsack Problem**, with emphasis on non-intrinsic variations such as increasing problem size. The problem is a classical NP-hard challenge with broad applications in resource allocation and logistics, making efficient solution strategies highly valuable. The work evaluates traditional classical optimization algorithms, including Dynamic Programming and Genetic Algorithms, alongside quantum-inspired techniques such as the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), Grover-based search optimization, and Quantum Annealing using QUBO formulations. Parallel computing strategies may also be explored if time permits. Performance is assessed using solution optimality, execution time, and resource efficiency, interpreted according to the computational paradigm. Classical methods provide deterministic outputs relying on CPU time and memory, while quantum methods yield probabilistic solutions requiring repeated circuit executions constrained by qubit fidelity and circuit depth. Comparisons focus on achieved solution quality, total time-to-solution, and scalability of computational resources. The study aims to highlight practical trade-offs among optimization strategies and provide guidance for selecting the most effective approach based on problem scale, available hardware, and desired solution quality.
